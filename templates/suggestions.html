    <h1>Precaution, Prevention, and Suggestions for Tomato Plant Diseases</h1>

    <h2>Bacterial Spot</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Monitor plants regularly and remove infected leaves immediately. Avoid handling wet plants to prevent spread.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Plant resistant varieties when available. Rotate crops and avoid overhead irrigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Apply copper-based fungicides early in the season. Maintain proper spacing between plants for good air circulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Blight</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Practice good garden sanitation by removing infected plant debris. Water plants at the base to avoid splashing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Rotate crops and avoid overcrowding. Mulch around plants to prevent soil-borne spores from splashing onto leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper. Prune lower leaves to improve airflow.
    </p>

    <h2>Late Blight</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread. Keep foliage dry by watering early in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Plant resistant varieties and space plants for good airflow. Avoid overhead irrigation and excess nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper. Avoid working with plants when foliage is wet.
    </p>

    <h2>Leaf Mold</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Provide good air circulation by spacing plants properly. Avoid working with plants when they are wet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Water plants at the base and avoid overhead irrigation. Remove infected leaves promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Apply fungicides containing copper. Use a well-draining soil mix and avoid overcrowding plants.
    </p>

    <h2>Septoria Leaf Spot</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent spread. Avoid overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Rotate crops and space plants for good airflow. Mulch around plants to prevent soil splashing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper. Prune lower leaves to improve air circulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Spider Mites</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Keep plants well-watered and reduce stress. Monitor for mites regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Use reflective mulch to deter mites. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that kill beneficial predators.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to control infestations. Increase humidity to discourage mites.
    </p>

    <h2>Target Spot</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Avoid overhead watering and overcrowding plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Rotate crops and use disease-resistant varieties. Space plants for good air circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper. Prune lower leaves to improve airflow.
    </p>

    <h2>Mosaic Virus</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Monitor plants regularly and remove infected leaves. Avoid handling plants when they are wet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Plant virus-resistant varieties and control aphids, which spread the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> There are no chemical treatments for viral infections. Remove infected plants promptly to prevent spread.
    </p>

    <h2>Yellow Leaf Curl Virus</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Precaution:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. Control whiteflies, which spread the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prevention:</strong> Plant resistant varieties and use reflective mulch to deter whiteflies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestions:</strong> There are no chemical treatments for viral infections. Remove infected plants promptly to prevent spread.
